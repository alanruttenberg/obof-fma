========

Work towards an OBO Foundry version of the FMA in OWL based on work described in the google group fma-owl-2009 
and initiated at Science Commons by Alan Ruttenberg

I am freezing the version in the Neurocommons repository http://svn.neurocommons.org/svn/trunk/convert/fma and moving 
code development here. The google group is at http://groups.google.com/d/forum/fma-owl-2009
